I am a computer and math geek currently working as Research Assistant Professor with the National Security Institute at Virginia Tech. My research is in development of theoretical and computational frameworks to address a number of data analytics problems, such as how to incorporate and balance data and expert opinion into decision-making, and how to estimate model parameters, including high- or even infinite-dimensional quantities, from noisy data. Areas of interest include: Bayesian Inference, Parameter Estimation, Optimal Control, Uncertainty Quantification, Numerical Analysis, Scientific Computing, and Machine Learning.

Prior to coming back to academia, I spent seven years in the public and private sectors doing transportation modeling for planning and evacuation applications; hurricane, pandemic, and other emergency preparedness; and project management.
