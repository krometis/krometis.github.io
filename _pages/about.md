I am a computer and math geek currently working as Research Assistant Professor
with the [National Security
Institute](https://www.research.vt.edu/institutes/virginia-tech-national-security-institute.html)
at Virginia Tech. I also hold an Adjunct Research Assistant Professor position in the [Math Department](https://math.vt.edu). My research is in development of theoretical and
computational frameworks to address data analytics problems, such
as how to incorporate and balance data and expert opinion into decision-making,
and how to estimate model parameters, including high- or even
infinite-dimensional quantities, from noisy data. Areas of interest include:
Statistical Inverse Problems, High-Performance Computing, Parameter Estimation, Uncertainty Quantification, Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML), Reinforcement Learning, Experimental Design, and Test and Evaluation of AI/ML systems.

Prior to joining VTNSI, I spent ten years supporting high-performance computing at Virginia Tech as a Computational Scientist with [Advanced Research Computing](https://arc.vt.edu). Prior to that, I spent seven years in the public and private sectors doing transportation modeling for planning and evacuation applications; hurricane, pandemic, and other emergency preparedness; and project management.
