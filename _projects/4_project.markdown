Test and evaluation (T&E) is a critical component of the Department of Defense's (DoD's) process for acquiring new systems because it provides essential assessment of the system's capabilities or deficiencies to help guide decision-making. However, the DoD faces unique challenges in designing and implementing quality tests due to the complexity of the systems and the difficulty and cost associated with approximating operational environments. While testing occurs as a system is being developed, estimation of operational behavior has traditionally been based on testing that occurs once a system has reached a near-final state.

The goal of this work has been to develop and apply advanced statistical techniques -- Bayesian inference and design of experiments in particular -- for integrating information from multiple phases of test, helping the DoD to more rapidly acquire and field new and effective capabilities.
